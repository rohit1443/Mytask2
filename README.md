# Mytask2: CI/CD Testing Project with Jenkins

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline using Jenkins for automated testing. The repository includes a simple Python web application along with a Jenkinsfile to manage the CI/CD process.

## Features
- **Automated Testing:** Runs unit tests automatically upon code changes.
- **Jenkins Integration:** Utilizes Jenkins for continuous integration, ensuring code quality and facilitating continuous delivery.
- **Python Application:** Contains a basic Python script (`testsite.py`) for demonstration purposes.

## Key Components
1. **Jenkinsfile:** Defines the pipeline stages, including build, test, and deployment steps.
2. **Python Script (`testsite.py`):** A simple script used to demonstrate the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **README.md:** Provides instructions on setting up and running the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohit1443/Mytask2.git
   cd Mytask2
# Access Jenkins

- **Open your Jenkins dashboard

## Run Unit Tests

1. Navigate to the `mytesting` job.
2. Click 'Build Now' to execute the tests.

## Jenkins Pipeline Overview

- **Build Stage:** Compiles and prepares the application for testing.
- **Test Stage:** Runs unit tests to ensure the code functions as expected.
- **Deploy Stage:** Deploys the application if all tests pass successfully.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jenkins**
